//! roc - command line doucmentation that rocks
//!
//! roc is an attempt at bringing godoc style quick docs searching to the command
//! line for rust. It doesn't generate any documentation itself, instead it relies
//! entirely on the local HTML output created by running `cargo doc` in the root of
//! your crate. You will need to have rust installed via rustup and have the std lib
//! docs downloaded in order to look at std lib.
